## Research topic:
Pediatric Nutritional Medicine and Intestinal Microbiology (repository name is the acronym)

## Field Work

During the internship, I did a research expedition to the East Nusa Tenggara Province (Kupang City & North Kodi Township). This experience involved participation in the organization and execution of a clinical trial, a significant endeavor aimed at advancing our understanding of probiotic efficacy.<br>

The crux of my responsibilities revolved around assistanship of organization and coordination of a clinical trial. This trial focused on over 200 children distributed across 4 distinct groups. I have visited group №2 & group №4.<br>

Blood and stool samples were systematically gathered from the participants.<br>

### Genome annotation of _Lpb. plantarum_ strain IS-10506

This [internship report](Genome%20annotation%20L.%20plantarum%20strain%20IS-10506) unveils a comprehensive genome-based safety assessment of the probiotic strain Lpb. plantarum IS-10506. The study explores bacteriocin clusters and CRISPR sequences, shedding light on its antimicrobial potential and defense mechanisms.
